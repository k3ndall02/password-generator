Hello! I am Kendall Coleman and this is my password generator.

This assignment was supposed to test my basic knowledge on Javascript, and it has.

I am slowly beginning to understand what Javascript is used for and how it works. My biggest struggle is knowing what to say to make certain things work. I haven't been able to focus on things much due to outside circumstances but plan to be back on track soon. I used a number of videos to help me understand this assignment but there was only one video that helped me the most. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/JheVaV6bPvE

From watching videos and going over past lessons I began to understand what was going on when I added something new to the Javascript file. 

I only made it as far as creating the criteria for the password. I know I needed to make multiple list for what could be used in the password so I made a variable container for uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. In order for the user to be asked what characters they want to use a window.confirm must be created. For the first window.promt, I wanted to create a question that would allow the user to continue with their password creation or cancel it but what I did wouldn't work. 

In the acceptance criteria is says that the length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters. The if statement suggests that if the user enters anything besides a number the input is invalid. It also suggests that any amount of characters less than 8 or greater than 128 will not work.
